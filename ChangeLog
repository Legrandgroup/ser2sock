v1.4.5 - 05/04/14 - Ron Curry, InSyte Technologies
    - ser2sock - Rewrote init.d script to easily accomodate multiple instances
    and added additional error checking and reporting.
    - ser2sock.c - Added "-P" option to allow optionally specify PID pathname
      to better support running mulitple instantiations via scripts.
      Prior to this  ser2sock would simply overwrite any previous PID file in
      /var/run
    - ser2sock.c - Added code to delete PID file apon exit
    - ser2sock.c - Changed logic which caused reading of a potentially non-
      existent default config file prior to reading command line arguments
      and prior to a specified config and fixed error reporting.
      Now it only read the correct file once after considering cmdline args
    - ser2sock.c - Added "PID_FILE" keyword/option to config file support
      Not needed for current init.d support but may be useful to some
    - Added trivial code to delete the /var/run/<PID_FILE> upon exit.
    - ser2sock.c - Added several additional syslog write to aid in debugging
    - ser2sock.c - Changed ser2sock version to 1.4.5 to reflect above changes
      Version 1.4.5 should remain fully compatible with 1.4.4 behaviour
