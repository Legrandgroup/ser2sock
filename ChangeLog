v1.5.5 - 11/28/17
    Improved init.d script to create PID folder and set permissions as needed as well
    as well as improve configuration for daemon owner and group.

v1.5.4 - 07/05/17
    Fixed a termination issue while debug logging.
    Updated configure scripts to use SSL_CTX_new instead of SSL_library_init to support OpenSSL 1.1
    Added a systemd script.

v1.5.3 - 03/15/17
    Lowered sleep duration in our main loop to increase throughput.
    Better Debian script setup and build instruction fixes.  Thanks Lionel!

v1.5.2 - 05/04/14 - Ron Curry, InSyte Technologies
    Rewrote init.d script to easily accomodate multiple instances
        and added additional error checking and reporting.
    Added "-P" option to allow optionally specify PID pathname
        to better support running mulitple instantiations via scripts.
        Prior to this ser2sock would simply overwrite any previous PID file in
        /var/run
    Added code to delete PID file apon exit
    Changed logic which caused reading of a potentially non-
        existent default config file prior to reading command line arguments
        and prior to a specified config and fixed error reporting. Now it only
        read the correct file once after considering cmdline args.
        (Scott) Reparsing arguments after config file reading in order to force
            them to take precedence.
    Added "PID_FILE" keyword/option to config file support. Not needed for
        current init.d support but may be useful to some
    Added several additional syslog write to aid in debugging
    Changed ser2sock version to 1.4.5 to reflect above changes
    Version 1.4.5 should remain fully compatible with 1.4.4 behaviour
